<i>-Hello?</i>
-Hey, Sean? Uh, this is...

161
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:08,541
<i>-Wesley, Tad's friend.</i>
-Uh, who?

162
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:12,291
<i>Sorry, I thought he maybe mentioned to you</i>
<i>that I'd be calling.</i>

163
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:14,791
<i>Oh, right, right... </i>
<i>Yeah. You're the magician.</i>

164
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:19,291
<i>No, I was the one that Tad thought</i>
<i>you might hit it off with.</i>

165
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:20,791
<i>Know what? We don't need to do this.</i>

166
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:23,000
<i>I think Tad</i>
<i>was just throwing crap at a wall.</i>

167
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:24,458
<i>Nah, I was just messing with you.</i>

168
00:07:24,541 --> 00:07:26,958
<i>-Most blind dates </i>are <i>crap, though.</i>
-[chuckles] Exactly.

169
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:30,500
<i>I always feel like, on a blind date,</i>
<i>you should have an automatic out.</i>

170
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:34,750
<i>You show up, say hi, no chemistry?</i>
<i>Just say no. Over.</i>

171
00:07:35,791 --> 00:07:38,791
<i>I'm talking to you right now,</i>
<i>I literally don't care about you.</i>

172
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,541
<i>You could get hit by a bus,</i>
<i>could care less.</i>

173
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:42,250
<i>[chuckles] I know. Exactly.</i>

174
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:45,916
<i>But look, um,</i>
<i>I'm just walking out of a movie right now.</i>

175
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,833
<i>-Okay.</i>
-Do you live near Echo Park?

176
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:49,791
<i>Maybe we could meet for a drink or...</i>

177
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:52,083
<i>Oh. Um...</i>

178
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:53,916
<i>That sounds great.</i>

179
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,916
<i>[lively music]</i>

180
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:02,750
<i>-Thank you so much.</i>
<i>-Good night, miss.</i>

181
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:03,666
<i>Good night.</i>

182
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:05,625
<i>[car door closes]</i>

183
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:10,000
<i>-Are you Sean?</i>
<i>-No, I'm not.</i>

184
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,666
<i>[footsteps]</i>

185
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:14,916
<i>[Sean] Uh...</i>

186
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:16,791
<i>-Wesley?</i>
<i>-Sean?</i>

187
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:18,958
<i>-Yes.</i>
<i>-Oh, thank God. [chuckles]</i>

188
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:21,500
<i>Thought you were that short dude</i>
<i>over there. He's adorable,</i>

189
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:23,708
<i>but our kids would be so short.</i>
<i>[chuckles]</i>

190
00:08:23,791 --> 00:08:25,250
<i>-Help me.</i>
<i>-[chuckles]</i>

191
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:27,458
<i>-Yes. Exactly.</i>
<i>-[chuckles]</i>

192
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:30,541
<i>-Hi.</i>
<i>-Oh, hi. I took a chance you like white.</i>

193
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:33,666
<i>Oh, Ordering for the lady. Strong open.</i>

194
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,583
<i>-Yeah.</i>
<i>-Um...</i>

195
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:38,458
<i>-So, how do you know Tad?</i>
<i>-"How do I know Tad?"</i>

196
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:41,208
<i>Let's see. I dated a girl in college</i>
<i>that he worked with.</i>

197
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:43,125
<i>-Jessie Harris?</i>
<i>-Yeah, I know Jessie.</i>

198
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:45,250
<i>-Okay.</i>
<i>-Wonder why she didn't try to set us up.</i>

199
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:47,083
<i>That's weird. Yeah, usually,</i>

200
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:48,333
<i>when girls get married,</i>

201
00:08:48,416 --> 00:08:51,166
<i>they try to yard-sale their reject pile.</i>

202
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:52,333
<i>"Reject pile." </i>

203
00:08:52,416 --> 00:08:55,416
<i>Ooh, I wish that hot husband of hers</i>
<i>was in the reject pile.</i>

204
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:57,541
<i>Have you seen their perfect baby?</i>

205
00:08:57,625 --> 00:08:59,375
<i>I love weddings.</i>
<i>Were you at their wedding?</i>

206
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:00,291
<i>You know what?</i>

207
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:02,583
<i>No.</i>

208
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:04,875
<i>Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.</i>
<i>Were you not invited?</i>

209
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:07,291
<i>-That was rude of me. [chuckles]</i>
<i>-No, I mean...</i>

210
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:10,708
<i>What I mean is... no.</i>

211
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:13,291
<i>I'm using my automatic out.</i>

212
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:17,000
<i>I'm sorry, what?</i>

213
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:18,833
<i>"Automatic out," what we spoke about.</i>

214
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:21,958
<i>If I wanna leave, if you wanna leave,</i>
<i>no harm, no foul?</i>

215
00:09:22,791 --> 00:09:25,250
<i>-I'm using that right now.</i>
-<i>Okay, we were riffing.</i>

216
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:28,583
<i>We were having a fun time.</i>
<i>Have you never been on a date?</i>

217
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:31,541
<i>I mean, come on, now. You were dropping</i>
<i>"marriage," "kids," "wedding"</i>

218
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:32,666
<i>in five seconds flat.</i>

219
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:34,500
<i>Not with us!</i>

220
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:36,583
<i>What are you doing?</i>

221
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:38,166
<i>We were just talking.</i>

222
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:39,750
<i>Wesley, you seem like a great girl. </i>

223
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:40,666
<i>I'm just...</i>

224
00:09:41,583 --> 00:09:43,791
<i>-The timing's not right for me.</i>
<i>-Guess what?</i>

225
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:45,500
<i>The timing isn't great</i>
<i>for me either, Sean.</i>

226
00:09:45,583 --> 00:09:46,541
<i>Wanna know why?</i>

227
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:49,250
<i>'Cause I've had a year from hell,</i>
<i>all right?</i>

228
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:51,625
<i>I've had 17 shitty job interviews.</i>

229
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:53,000
<i>Twice as many bad dates.</i>

230
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:54,625
<i>Okay, my car was destroyed,</i>

231
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:57,875
<i>I'm on a budget,</i>
<i>so I steal food from the kid I babysit,</i>

232
00:09:57,958 --> 00:09:59,916
<i>and all of my birds died this year.</i>

233
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,125
<i>And my hair is falling out of my head</i>
<i>'cause I blow it out five times a week,</i>

234
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:08,041
<i>and despite my best efforts,</i>
<i>I'm still treading water,</i>

235
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:10,500
<i>sitting here on dates with dudes like you,</i>

236
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:12,833
<i>wondering what my life is gonna be like.</i>

237
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:15,291
<i>Wow.</i>

238
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:19,250
<i>-Unbelievable. [scoffs]</i>
<i>-Excuse me.</i>

239
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:21,458
<i>[scoffs]</i>

240
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:24,041
<i>-Baby...</i>
<i>-Come on. [screams]</i>

<i>-[thuds]</i>
<i>-[pedestrians gasping]</i>

242
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:30,083
<i>[echoing] Ma'am. Do you hear me, ma'am?</i>

243
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:32,458
<i>Ma'am, I'm an LA City reserve firefighter,</i>

244
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:34,000
<i>I was walking by when you fell.</i>

245
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:35,750
<i>Cool. Thanks, man. I--</i>

246
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:38,500
<i>Ma'am, you're gonna be okay, okay?</i>
<i>Don't freak out.</i>

247
00:10:38,583 --> 00:10:39,958
<i>I feel fine. </i>

248
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:41,708
<i>[groans]</i>

249
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,375
<i>Hey, there. You okay?</i>

250
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:48,291
<i>Oh, my God. Who are you?</i>

251
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:49,916
<i>I'm Jared Sterling.</i>

252
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:53,250
<i>I saw your purse</i>
<i>go flying into oncoming traffic.</i>

253
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:54,875
<i>I thought you might need some help.</i>

254
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:59,458
<i>Wesley Darya of Belmont Avenue,</i>
<i>who wears contacts</i>

255
00:10:59,541 --> 00:11:02,125
<i>and somehow got a nice picture</i>
<i>on their license.</i>

256
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:04,000
<i>Oh, my God. Shut up. [chuckles]</i>

257
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:07,875
<i>You okay? You wanna get up?</i>
<i>All right.</i>

258
00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:11,500
<i>Well, time to go to the hospital.</i>
<i>I'm down to take you in my Jetta.</i>

259
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:13,958
<i>I'm fine.</i>
<i>I'll have my friends look out for me.</i>

260
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:15,666
<i>Yeah. Oh, okay.</i>

261
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:17,291
<i>You know what? I...</i>

262
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:20,166
<i>I live just around the corner.</i>
<i>If you wanna come over,</i>

263
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:22,416
<i>you can call some friends</i>
<i>to come pick you up.</i>

264
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,500
<i>-I do.</i>
<i>-I honestly barely ever kill people.</i>

265
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:26,500
<i>[chuckles]</i>

266
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:28,416

<i>Great. Still not answering,</i>
<i>but I can go home.</i>

270
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:45,458
<i>You don't need to babysit me.</i>

271
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:48,750
<i>Oh, no. Don't worry about it.</i>
<i>I just got back from China.</i>

272
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,666
<i>I'd be up all night.</i>
<i>You're doing me a favor.</i>

273

<i>Okay. [chuckles]</i>

274
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:02,125
<i>Aw, cute kid.</i>

275
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,500
<i>Oh, yeah. That's my nephew.</i>

00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:07,250
<i>-Hope my own turn out half as great.</i>
<i>-Hmm.</i>

277
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:11,083
<i>-Yours in the future?</i>
<i>-Mm-hmm. Yeah.</i>

278
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:14,416
<i>-So, your name's Wesley.</i>
<i>-Uh-mm.</i>

279
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:15,375
<i>Beautiful eyes.</i>

280
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:16,916
<i>Ooh.</i>

281
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:19,708
<i>-Organ donor.</i>
<i>-Please don't harvest my kidneys.</i>

282
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:23,375
<i>I didn't mean to look at your organs</i>
<i>when I said that. It was just natural.</i>

283
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:24,875
<i>[both chuckles]</i>

284
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:27,250
<i>Uh, no. I'm a sports agent.</i>

285
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:30,291
<i>Okay? We only feed on people's careers.</i>

286
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,916
<i>I don't know anything about agents,</i>

287
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:37,250
<i>so, I... guess I don't have an opinion.</i>

288
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:41,041
<i>My brain's not really working right now,</i>
<i>sorry. [chuckles]</i>

289
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:42,458
<i>I love that.</i>

290
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:46,625
<i>Now I know what my problem is.</i>

291
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:48,458
<i>I've been being too...</i>

<i>myself.</i>

293
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:53,166
<i>Yeah. I discovered the secret to men.</i>

294
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:56,500
<i>Don't speak.</i>
<i>Look, I'm just facing the facts.</i>

295
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:58,791
<i>-My personality is an acquired taste.</i>
<i>-Hmm.</i>

296
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:01,166
<i>I love the way your personality tastes.</i>

297
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,958
<i>I think this is meant to be.</i>

298
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:04,500
<i>This is exactly like the book</i>

299
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:06,500
<i>I'm reading right now</i>
<i>for my pregnancy journey.</i>

300
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:09,791
<i>It's written by a Mexican shaman named</i>
<i>Ángel de la Paz,</i>

301
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:11,500
<i>-angel of peace. </i>
<i>-Really?</i>

302
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:12,958
<i>Another shaman?</i>

303
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:15,791
<i>You might as well be flushing</i>
<i>all of your money down the toilet.</i>

304
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:17,875
<i>How much did you spend on the last one?</i>

305
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:20,416
<i>Eleven thousand four hundred</i>
<i>and eighty dollars.</i>

306
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:23,000
<i>-Right?</i>
<i>-That's a lot of money.</i>

307
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:25,000
<i>Listen, the book says</i>

308
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:27,583
<i>the universe throws</i>
<i>a bunch of darkness your way</i>

309
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:30,333
<i>that you have to suffer through</i>
<i>in order to find your true path</i>

310
00:13:30,416 --> 00:13:33,125
<i>so that you can appreciate</i>
<i>the good things when they come.</i>

311
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:34,083
<i>Like Jared.</i>

312
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:36,083
<i>Thank God. I'm just so relieved.</i>

313
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:38,958
<i>-I was starting to think I was cursed.</i>
<i>-You always think you're cursed.</i>

314
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:40,625
<i>What do you actually know about this guy?</i>

315
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:43,666
<i>He wants kids. He owns a duvet cover.</i>

316
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:46,125
<i>He liked me with a slight concussion.</i>

317
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:49,041
<i>-What more do I want?</i>
-<i>What does he know about you?</i>

318
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:53,000
<i>He knows that I'm pretty fucking sexy</i>
<i>when I'm not talking so much.</i>

319
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:56,041
<i>Okay,</i>

00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:50,000
<i>-Had to fly to Cabo to deal with it.</i>
-I'm fucked. Stop!

480
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:52,333
<i>Oh, no. I feel so awful.</i>

481
00:20:52,416 --> 00:20:53,416
<i>No, I do.</i>

482
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:56,000
<i>I can't believe we haven't talked</i>
<i>for five days.</i>

483
00:20:56,083 --> 00:20:57,500
<i>You weren't pissed off, were you?</i>

484
00:20:57,583 --> 00:20:59,458
<i>What? [chuckles] No, no, no.</i>

485
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:02,083
<i>Wes, thanks for being so cool</i>
<i>about me not calling.</i>

486
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:04,375
<i>-[whispering] Fuckers.</i>
<i>-Most girls would've freaked out.</i>

487
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:07,458
<i>You know me.</i>
<i>It takes a lot to get me worked up. Pfft.</i>

488
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:09,208
<i>Yeah, I know.</i>
<i>That's what I love about you.</i>

489
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:10,375
<i>You're so reasonable.</i>

490
00:21:11,041 --> 00:21:13,541
<i>Might be the last normal girl left in LA.</i>
<i>[groans]</i>

491
00:21:13,625 --> 00:21:15,500
<i>-Can I call you back, Jar?</i>
<i>-What? No.</i>

492
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:19,791
<i>No. My phone's at the casita,</i>
<i>back at the Las Playas resort.</i>

493
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:21,958
<i>-They won't let me have my work stuff.</i>
-Oh, my God.

494
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:23,208
<i>They just want me to rest.</i>

495
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:26,333
<i>I'll call you when I know more, all right?</i>
<i>I miss you.</i>

496
00:21:26,416 --> 00:21:28,541
<i>I miss you too. God.</i>

497
00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:30,625
<i>-[singing] Success tastes good.</i>
<i>-Success tastes good.</i>

498
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:32,166
<i>-Success tastes sweet.</i>
<i>-Don't send it. He was</i>

499
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:33,166
<i>-in a coma!</i>
<i>-The e-mail sent!</i>

500
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,750
<i>[pants] Wait, what did you say?</i>

501
00:21:35,708 --> 00:21:37,000
<i>Jared was in a coma?</i>

502
00:21:37,083 --> 00:21:39,500
<i>Yes, since Tuesday, in Mexico.</i>

503
00:21:39,583 --> 00:21:41,583
<i>Wh-What was the thing you said</i>
<i>right before that?</i>

504
00:21:41,666 --> 00:21:43,875
<i>Hmm. [gulps] No, I didn't say anything.</i>

505
00:21:46,041 --> 00:21:48,875
<i>-What did she say?</i>
<i>-We sent the e-mail.</i>

506
00:21:48,958 --> 00:21:50,041
<i>-What? </i>
<i>-[sighs]</i>

507
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:51,125
<i>[screams]</i>

508
00:21:51,208 --> 00:21:52,666
<i>Well, that's what you told us to do.</i>

509
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:53,750
<i>-No.</i>
<i>-Oh, my God.</i>

510
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:55,625
<i>-[shuddering] Oh, my God.</i>
<i>-I'm gonna pass away.</i>

511
00:21:55,708 --> 00:21:58,541
<i>Just... I'm gonna just... pass away.</i>

512
00:21:58,916 --> 00:22:01,291
<i>-Now, let me go. I'm dead.</i>
<i>-No, no, no, no, no.</i>

513
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:03,125
<i>Oh, I have an idea.</i>

514
00:22:03,666 --> 00:22:06,333
<i>We'll just send him another e-mail.</i>

515
00:22:06,416 --> 00:22:09,625
<i>Subject line:</i>
<i>"Do not read the last e-mail."</i>

516
00:22:09,708 --> 00:22:11,791
<i>No! What's wrong with you? Don't do that.</i>

517
00:22:11,875 --> 00:22:14,083
<i>If I got an e-mail saying,</i>
<i>"Don't read the last e-mail,"</i>

518
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,333
<i>that's the first thing I'd do.</i>

519
00:22:15,416 --> 00:22:17,583
<i>[sighs] Fuck, you're right. </i>
<i>I'm sorry. I'm drunk.</i>

520
00:22:17,666 --> 00:22:20,083
<i>We need to get out of this.</i>
<i>Where's the computer?</i>

521
00:22:20,375 --> 00:22:21,500
<i>Give me the computer.</i>

522
00:22:21,583 --> 00:22:24,000
<i>-Give it to me. [breathes deeply]</i>
<i>-Okay. It's gonna be okay.</i>

523
00:22:24,083 --> 00:22:26,333
<i>It's gonna be okay.</i>
<i>Just write him something really sweet.</i>

524
00:22:26,916 --> 00:22:28,625
<i>"My tender heart.</i>

525
00:22:28,958 --> 00:22:30,833
<i>My angel whisperer."</i>

526
00:22:30,958 --> 00:22:32,000
<i>Um...</i>

527
00:22:32,083 --> 00:22:33,250
<i>Are you naming Care Bears?</i>

528
00:22:33,375 --> 00:22:36,916
<i>[gasps] Maybe he got amnesia in his coma</i>
<i>and he forgot his password.</i>

529
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
<i>Mm, His password. </i>
<i>Do you know his password?</i>

530
00:22:40,083 --> 00:22:42,958
<i>No, I don't know his password.</i>
<i>We've been dating a month.</i>

531
00:22:43,291 --> 00:22:46,000
<i>I knew Dave's by day five.</i>
<i>I wouldn't blow him until he told me.</i>

532
00:22:46,083 --> 00:22:48,833
<i>There's gotta be something. </i>
<i>Ugh. Think.</i>

533
00:22:48,916 --> 00:22:51,000
<i>-What are we gonna do?</i>
<i>-What the hell are we gonna do?</i>

534
00:22:51,083 --> 00:22:52,583
<i>There's gotta be something we could do.</i>

535
00:22:52,666 --> 00:22:55,458
<i>-Just tell him you are possessed.</i>
<i>-'Cause that makes him wanna date me.</i>

536
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:57,416
<i>-Tell him you love thin dicks.</i>
<i>-But I don't.</i>

537
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,125
<i>"I have a drinking problem."</i>

538
00:22:59,208 --> 00:23:01,875
<i>None of these things are gonna make him</i>
<i>want to continue dating me.</i>

539
00:23:01,958 --> 00:23:04,500
<i>I... Oh, my God.</i>
<i>I don't know. I don't know what to do.</i>

540
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:07,791
<i>I mean, the only thing you could do</i>
<i>is just go delete the e-mail</i>

541
00:23:07,875 --> 00:23:10,458
<i>from all of his devices,</i>
<i>which are God knows where.</i>

542
00:23:10,541 --> 00:23:12,291
<i>I know where they are. In his hotel room.</i>

543
00:23:12,375 --> 00:23:13,625
<i>A lot of good that does.</i>

544
00:23:16,083 --> 00:23:16,916
<i>You guys...</i>

545
00:23:18,041 --> 00:23:20,166
<i>I want you to take this really seriously.</i>

546
00:23:22,291 --> 00:23:27,208
<i>Would it be insane if I went to Mexico</i>
<i>and erased the e-mail?</i>

547
00:23:27,916 --> 00:23:28,833
<i>-Yes.</i>
<i>-No.</i>

548
00:23:29,291 --> 00:23:30,208
<i>Kaylie.</i>

549
00:23:30,291 --> 00:23:32,541
<i>You guys, it could be a fun girls' trip.</i>
<i>We could all go.</i>

550
00:23:32,625 --> 00:23:34,875
<i>Just the three of us.</i>
<i>How fun will that be?</i>

551
00:23:34,958 --> 00:23:36,208
<i>We haven't done that in so long.</i>

552
00:23:36,291 --> 00:23:38,041
<i>-Oh, no. I'm not going to Mexico.</i>
<i>-To Mexico?</i>

553
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:40,916
<i>-I can't leave the country right now.</i>
<i>-You could have a revenge affair.</i>

554
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,166
<i>Think of how fun that'll be.</i>
<i>You deserve it.</i>

555
00:23:43,875 --> 00:23:46,250
<i>You guys, if I go alone, it's stalking.</i>
<i>If you're there...</i>

556
00:23:46,583 --> 00:23:49,208
<i>it's still stalking,</i>
<i>but it's also a fun vacation...</i>

557
00:23:49,291 --> 00:23:50,500
<i>-after this.</i>
<i>-Oh, my God.</i>

558
00:23:50,583 --> 00:23:53,458
<i>-I mean, Ángel has a retreat near Cabo.</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

559
00:23:53,541 --> 00:23:55,458
<i>-Maybe I could go to do that.</i>
<i>-Great. Hit that up.</i>

560
00:23:55,541 --> 00:23:58,250
<i>-Okay.</i>
<i>-Perfect. Good reasons are piling up.</i>

561
00:23:58,333 --> 00:23:59,208
<i>-This is great.</i>
<i>-Yeah.</i>

562
00:23:59,291 --> 00:24:02,291
<i>I think that you guys are gonna have</i>
<i>the best time in Mexico.</i>

563
00:24:02,375 --> 00:24:04,958
<i>And I am not going anywhere</i>
<i>with either of you--</i>

564
00:24:05,041 --> 00:24:06,166
<i>We're going to Mexico.</i>

565
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:08,375
<i>because this plan is absolutely insane.</i>
<i>And...</i>

566
00:24:09,958 --> 00:24:13,375
<i>No, no, no, no, no.</i>
<i>don't give me those puppy-dog eyes</i>

567
00:24:13,458 --> 00:24:15,958
<i>that you do.</i>
<i>I hate that when you do that.</i>

568
00:24:16,041 --> 00:24:17,083
<i>And don't give me</i>

569
00:24:17,166 --> 00:24:20,333
<i>that weird little cat-like grin</i>
<i>on your face.</i>

570
00:24:20,416 --> 00:24:25,250
<i>Come on, guys. It's one hour of burglary</i>
<i>and two days by the pool. [chuckles]</i>

571
00:24:25,333 --> 00:24:26,958
<i>Okay? This is all I have.</i>

572
00:24:27,041 --> 00:24:29,916
<i>If Jared reads that e-mail,</i>
<i>my life is over--</i>

573
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,458
<i>Wesley, stop. Please, just stop.</i>

574
00:24:32,291 --> 00:24:34,750
<i>Okay, this pitch is fricking horrible,</i>

575
00:24:35,583 --> 00:24:36,625
<i>but I...</i>

576
00:24:37,583 --> 00:24:40,208
<i>love you, and I do wanna see you happy.</i>

577
00:24:40,291 --> 00:24:42,333
<i>I love you too. Come on.</i>

578
00:24:42,833 --> 00:24:46,083
<i>[sighs] </i>
<i>I can't believe that I'm gonna say this,</i>

579
00:24:48,125 --> 00:24:50,375
<i>but let's go break into some dude's room.</i>

580
00:24:50,583 --> 00:24:53,625
<i>[enthusiastic music] </i>

581
00:25:07,041 --> 00:25:08,625
<i>-Wow.</i>
<i>-[chuckles]</i>

582
00:25:20,125 --> 00:25:21,375
<i>[speaking Spanish]</i>

583
00:25:21,458 --> 00:25:22,958
<i>My God. That's so...</i>

584
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,875
<i>Ramon will show you to your casita.</i>

585
00:25:30,333 --> 00:25:32,416
<i>Enjoy your stay, señora Darya.</i>

586
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,750
<i>Uh, before we go up,</i>
<i>could you show me which casita</i>

587
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:36,166
<i>Jared Sterling is in?</i>

588
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:37,541
<i>Yeah. Allow me to connect you.</i>

589
00:25:37,625 --> 00:25:39,833
<i>Oh, he's actually not there right now.</i>

590
00:25:39,916 --> 00:25:42,541
<i>Ah. Perfect. Then, I will take a message.</i>

591
00:25:42,625 --> 00:25:46,041
<i>I was hoping I could just slip</i>
<i>a little note under his door.</i>

592
00:25:46,125 --> 00:25:48,916
<i>It's actually against hotel policy</i>
<i>to give out room numbers.</i>

593
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:49,875
<i>You understand.</i>

594
00:25:49,958 --> 00:25:50,916
<i>[speaking Spanish]</i>

595
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,291
<i>Uh, sir. I've got the bag-- Hold on--</i>

596
00:25:53,375 --> 00:25:55,833
<i>-[yelps] Oh, my God.</i>
<i>-[gasps]</i>

597
00:25:55,958 --> 00:25:56,958
<i>Oh, boy.</i>

598
00:25:57,416 --> 00:26:00,125
<i>Whoa, Mom. This is neat.</i>

599
00:26:00,208 --> 00:26:01,750
<i>-[gasps] Oh!</i>
<i>-[speaking Spanish]</i>

600
00:26:01,833 --> 00:26:03,250
<i>-He's touching it.</i>
<i>-[gasps]</i>

601
00:26:03,375 --> 00:26:04,666
<i>Why is it shaking so much?</i>

602
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:05,958
<i>-It feels kinda weird.</i>
<i>-Nolan,</i>

603
00:26:06,041 --> 00:26:07,833
<i>-put that down now.</i>
<i>-But it looks funny.</i>

604
00:26:08,375 --> 00:26:10,375
<i>-What kind of toy is this?</i>
<i>-Ugh.</i>

605
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,875
<i>-Can't use that again.</i>
<i>-Drop it.</i>

606
00:26:12,375 --> 00:26:14,375
<i>When Mommy says, "Drop it," we drop it.</i>

607
00:26:14,458 --> 00:26:17,333
<i>Hey, buddy. That's actually my...</i>

608
00:26:17,958 --> 00:26:18,958
<i>little toy. [chuckles]</i>

609
00:26:19,083 --> 00:26:22,000
<i>For a second there,</i>
<i>I thought my 12-year-old owned a sex toy.</i>

610
00:26:22,083 --> 00:26:23,208
<i>No, it's </i>my <i>dildo.</i>

611
00:26:23,625 --> 00:26:25,875
<i>What is going on here?</i>
<i>Is this a sex resort?</i>

612
00:26:25,958 --> 00:26:27,750
<i>-[scoffs] No, this is not--</i>
<i>-What?</i>

613
00:26:27,833 --> 00:26:29,166
<i>That was not in the brochure!</i>

614
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:31,875
<i>Actually,</i>
<i>teaching your child about self-love</i>

615
00:26:31,958 --> 00:26:33,958
<i>is a really beautiful gift.</i>

616
00:26:34,041 --> 00:26:34,875
<i>Oh, really?</i>

617
00:26:35,166 --> 00:26:37,625
<i>I think a beautiful gift</i>
<i>is a beautiful vacation,</i>

618
00:26:37,708 --> 00:26:39,083
<i>and it's now basically ruined.</i>

619
00:26:39,166 --> 00:26:41,666
<i>-I feel like you're mad.</i>
<i>-Nolan, let's go.</i>

620
00:26:41,875 --> 00:26:42,791
<i>-Why, Mom?</i>
<i>-Come.</i>

621
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,333
<i>-She seemed nice.</i>
<i>-Poor kid.</i>

622
00:26:44,916 --> 00:26:47,041
<i>-God damn it.</i>
<i>-Wow, she came in strong.</i>

623
00:26:47,541 --> 00:26:48,375
<i>[chuckles]</i>

624
00:26:48,458 --> 00:26:50,666
<i>You have complicated things.</i>
<i>May we go to our room?</i>

625
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:52,833
<i>-Let's get a drink.</i>
<i>-Thank you.</i>

626
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,541
<i>Gracias. Okay.</i>

627
00:26:59,625 --> 00:27:00,625
<i>[speaking Spanish]</i>

628
00:27:00,708 --> 00:27:02,333
<i>Gracias.</i>

629
00:27:02,416 --> 00:27:03,666
<i>-This is nice.</i>
<i>-Oh, wow.</i>

630
00:27:04,166 --> 00:27:05,833
<i>I hope this minibar's a megabar.</i>

631
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:07,583
<i>Phew!</i>

632
00:27:07,916 --> 00:27:10,791
<i>Hey, "automatic out" girl.</i>

633
00:27:11,083 --> 00:27:13,583
<i>Come on. What's up?</i>

634
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:16,125
<i>What are you doing here in, uh, Cabo?</i>

635

<i>That's a weird coincidence.</i>
<i>I'm doing the exact same thing.</i>

637
00:27:19,833 --> 00:27:22,458
<i>Yeah, it's totally crazy</i>
<i>for two people from LA</i>

638
00:27:22,541 --> 00:27:24,125
<i>to be in Cabo at the same time.</i>

639

<i>Probably not. [chuckles]</i>
<i>I know. That's why it's so weird.</i>

641

<i>You think I followed you here</i>
<i>like a lunatic</i>

00:27:31,125 --> 00:27:32,291
<i>'cause I'm obsessed with you?</i>

643

<i>No.</i>

644
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:35,416
<i>I followed someone else here...</i>

<i>like a lunatic</i>
<i>'cause I'm so obsessed with him.</i>

646

<i>-Oh. You have a new boyfriend?</i>
<i>-Mm-hmm.</i>

647
00:27:41,208 --> 00:27:44,416
<i>That's-- Congratulations.</i>
<i>That's a-- I mean, you work fast, but--</i>

648
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:47,625
<i>That's what happens when you give someone</i>
<i>more than ten seconds at a bar.</i>

649
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:50,666
<i>-Listen. I've been meaning to call you.</i>
<i>-Oh, why?</i>

650

<i>-Q?</i>
<i>-How could I forget?</i>

<i>What?</i>

801
00:34:34,958 --> 00:34:36,833
<i>I googled your pink penis toy.</i>

<i>It's called a vibrator,</i>

<i>We're just in all-day workshops</i>

814

<i>Technically, the name is "Bonalis,"</i>

<i>the brand name. [chuckles]</i>

<i>I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.</i>

818
00:35:25,208 --> 00:35:27,708
<i>Why does the world need more boner pills?</i>

819
00:35:27,791 --> 00:35:29,250
<i>Am I right? [chuckles]</i>

820
00:35:29,333 --> 00:35:32,916
<i>I mean, can't we just invent a drug</i>
<i>that keeps a guy's dick in his pants?</i>

821

<i>[chuckles]</i>

<i>Thank you. Oh, what about--?</i>

824
00:35:36,875 --> 00:35:39,000
<i>Could you actually make a good dick GPS?</i>

825
00:35:39,083 --> 00:35:41,625
<i>So that way,</i>
<i>when a dick is going in another woman,</i>

826
00:35:41,708 --> 00:35:45,416
<i>it sets off this little switch</i>
<i>that just fries his pecker right off.</i>

827
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:46,333
<i>Oh.</i>

828
00:35:46,416 --> 00:35:48,416
<i>-That sounds like a human rights crime.</i>
<i>-Right?</i>

829
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:50,666
<i>-Seems harsh. [chuckles]</i>
<i>-That's pretty funny.</i>

830
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:53,000
<i>-Thank you.</i>
<i>-I mean, maybe not the best joke...</i>

831
00:35:53,083 --> 00:35:55,625
<i>to make when you wanna pick me up</i>
<i>or anything, but-- [chuckles]</i>

832

<i>[chuckles]</i>

833
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:58,666
<i>Oh, I'm sorry.</i>

834
00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:00,750
<i>You thought</i>
<i>that I was trying to pick you up?</i>

835
00:36:01,541 --> 00:36:04,125
<i>-I'm sorry, what else are we doing here?</i>
<i>-I'm sorry.</i>

836
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:09,291
<i>It's just, you're wearing man-sandals</i>
<i>and like five million bracelets.</i>

837
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:10,833
<i>I told you just to pick one bracelet.</i>

838
00:36:10,916 --> 00:36:13,333
<i>I can't pick just one bracelet.</i>
<i>They're all fucking cool.</i>

839
00:36:13,875 --> 00:36:15,083
<i>Should've picked one.</i>

840
00:36:15,166 --> 00:36:19,625
<i>I was kinda getting the vibe</i>
<i>that you may be DTF when we sat down.</i>

841
00:36:19,708 --> 00:36:23,291
<i>But you also seem to have, like,</i>
<i>a darkness and a sadness about you,</i>

842
00:36:23,375 --> 00:36:24,666
<i>and it's, like, a real turnoff.</i>

843
00:36:25,291 --> 00:36:27,083
<i>I feel like I was a bit misled.</i>

844
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:29,916
<i>I already took a Bonalis, so... [chuckles]</i>

845
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:34,666
<i>I'm... gonna have to nurse this boner here</i>
<i>pretty soon.</i>

846

<i>Oh, really? What hand are you gonna use?</i>

847
00:36:36,958 --> 00:36:39,416
<i>The one with all the bracelets</i>
<i>all over it?</i>

848
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:42,375
<i>Well, what are you gonna do? You gonna...</i>
<i>finger yourself in that pantsuit?</i>

849
00:36:42,458 --> 00:36:43,666
<i>-I mean, come on.</i>
<i>-Jesus.</i>

850
00:36:44,208 --> 00:36:46,625
<i>Yeah, I'm gonna jack off</i>
<i>with these bracelets.</i>

851
00:36:46,708 --> 00:36:48,916
<i>And I guess I'm gonna have to take it</i>
<i>to the pool</i>

852
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,916
<i>because I don't have a chest</i>
<i>to jizz on tonight.</i>

00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,458
<i>-Whoa..</i>
<i>-Oh, my.</i>

00:36:53,541 --> 00:36:54,750
<i>-All right, I'm out.</i>
<i>-Right.</i>

<i>-Oh, my God.</i>
<i>-What?</i>

859
00:36:59,416 --> 00:37:00,875
<i>That's a really small plate.</i>

860
00:37:00,958 --> 00:37:02,666
<i>It's the biggest plate they have!</i>

861
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:05,125
<i>I'm so sorry about that.</i>

862

<i>He's going through</i>
<i>a custody battle right now--</i>

863
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:08,750
<i>Well, he technically gave up his kids.</i>

864
00:37:08,833 --> 00:37:10,125
<i>Listen, I love you.</i>

865
00:37:10,208 --> 00:37:12,083
<i>-I love you too.</i>
<i>-I'm gonna put you in my pocket</i>

866
00:37:12,166 --> 00:37:13,666

<i>-Please.</i>
<i>-Find me at the resort, okay?</i>

868
00:37:15,291 --> 00:37:17,125
<i>-I'm going to.</i>
<i>-Bye.</i>

869
00:37:17,208 --> 00:37:19,583

<i>Or do I forgive him?</i>

887
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,208

1426
01:01:19,833 --> 01:01:22,958
<i>-so it might be a few hours, okay?</i> <i>Bye.</i>
-Okay.

1427
01:01:23,541 --> 01:01:26,125
<i>Sorry, just making travel arrangements</i>
<i>with my girlfriend.</i>

1428
01:01:27,166 --> 01:01:28,666
<i>Just called me his girlfriend.</i>

1429
01:01:28,750 --> 01:01:31,666
<i>He just called me his girlfriend!</i>
<i>Did you hear that?</i>

1430
01:01:32,250 --> 01:01:34,958
<i>-Shut up, now this is a big deal for you.</i>
<i>-It is.</i>

1431
01:01:35,041 --> 01:01:36,250
<i>This means so much.</i>

1432
01:01:36,541 --> 01:01:38,208
<i>Now, you get to tell the kids</i>

1433
01:01:38,291 --> 01:01:41,833
<i>how Mommy stalked Daddy all the way</i>
<i>to Mexico like a bounty hunter.</i>

1434
01:01:42,166 --> 01:01:44,416
<i>I have to ask you something.</i>
<i>Please say yes.</i>

1435
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:46,833
<i>Will you take me</i>
<i>to the airport to see him? Please?</i>

1436
01:01:46,916 --> 01:01:48,916
<i>I mean, I'm already invested, so...</i>

1437
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:50,583
<i>-to see how this--</i>
<i>-[gasps] Yes!</i>

1438
01:01:50,666 --> 01:01:52,708
<i>Oh, my God! [chuckles]</i>

1439
01:01:52,791 --> 01:01:55,166
<i>God, this is so good. What is in this tea?</i>

1440
01:01:55,250 --> 01:01:57,375
<i>Ah, I think that's just regular green tea.</i>

1441
01:01:57,458 --> 01:01:59,625
<i>I don't think so.</i>
<i>I mean, it's got a spice to it.</i>

1442
01:01:59,708 --> 01:02:01,791
<i>-It's so good.</i>
<i>-Oh, lookee here...</i>

1443
01:02:02,333 --> 01:02:06,041
<i>"Remove your inner thorn."</i>
<i>Mm. That sounds painful.</i>

1444
01:02:06,958 --> 01:02:09,791
<i>I know, Brookie.</i>
<i>I used to think it was bullshit too,</i>

1445
01:02:10,125 --> 01:02:12,583
<i>then I actually read the book,</i>
<i>and it spoke to me.</i>

1446
01:02:12,666 --> 01:02:15,125
<i>[smacks lips] Oh, really? </i>
<i>What did it say to you?</i>

1447
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:18,000
<i>It said "Be a tree. Find your roots."</i>

1448
01:02:18,083 --> 01:02:20,083
<i>Really? It's fascinating.</i>

1449
01:02:21,541 --> 01:02:22,500
<i>Okay.</i>

1450
01:02:23,958 --> 01:02:25,416
<i>Thanks. It's delicious.</i>

1451
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:27,625
<i>Oh, my God. It's so hot here, I wanna die.</i>

1452
01:02:27,875 --> 01:02:30,625
<i>-Look at this. Look how big this jungle--</i>
<i>-Hola, ladies.</i>

1453
01:02:31,166 --> 01:02:32,000
<i>Hi.</i>

1454
01:02:33,208 --> 01:02:34,833
<i>Welcome to the heart sanctuary.</i>

1455
01:02:35,833 --> 01:02:37,916
<i>-Let's go.</i>
<i>-Since when is she a chick?</i>

1456
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,708
<i>[whispers] I never said Ángel was a man.</i>

1457
01:02:39,791 --> 01:02:40,958
<i>Well, forgive me for assuming</i>

1458
01:02:41,041 --> 01:02:44,041
<i>that a scam artist, hippie, sociopath</i>
<i>wouldn't be a woman.</i>

1459
01:02:44,125 --> 01:02:46,250
<i>Welcome. I'm Ángel de la Paz.</i>

1460
01:02:46,333 --> 01:02:48,833
<i>Hi. I'm Brooke de Ketel One.</i>

1461
01:02:51,125 --> 01:02:54,250
<i>I'm Kaylie. [chuckles]</i>
<i>I'm so honored to be here. Thank you.</i>

1462
01:02:54,333 --> 01:02:57,000
<i>You're so beautiful and amazing,</i>

1463
01:02:57,083 --> 01:03:00,375
<i>and I just wanna say namaste.</i>

1464
01:03:00,458 --> 01:03:03,333
<i>God bless. Shabbat shalom! Mazel tov.</i>

1465
01:03:03,916 --> 01:03:05,583
<i>Thank you. I love you.</i>

1466
01:03:05,666 --> 01:03:07,666
<i>[sighs] How can I help you two?</i>

1467
01:03:07,750 --> 01:03:09,083
<i>Oh, actually, just her.</i>

1468
01:03:09,166 --> 01:03:12,041
<i>I like my healers with an MD</i>
<i>and access to Vicodin.</i>

1469
01:03:12,458 --> 01:03:15,208
<i>I'm sorry for my friend.</i>
<i>I'm-I'm trying to get pregnant.</i>

1470
01:03:15,666 --> 01:03:19,791
<i>-Have you seen a fertility doctor?</i>
<i>-Yes. Seen every doctor in LA,</i>

1471
01:03:19,875 --> 01:03:21,875
<i>and nothing has worked.</i>

1472
01:03:23,583 --> 01:03:26,083
<i>I'm sorry. This must be very painful.</i>

1473
01:03:26,916 --> 01:03:27,833
<i>Thank you. [sighs]</i>

1474
01:03:28,583 --> 01:03:29,416
<i>[inhales deeply]</i>

1475
01:03:29,958 --> 01:03:31,500
<i>There's nothing I can do for you.</i>

1476
01:03:32,916 --> 01:03:36,166
<i>What? No, I'm in Mexico.</i>

1477
01:03:36,666 --> 01:03:39,166
<i>I read all the things</i>
<i>about all the women who come visit you.</i>

1478
01:03:39,250 --> 01:03:43,250
<i>I can't help you get pregnant,</i>
<i>but I think you'll be a great mother.</i>

1479
01:03:46,750 --> 01:03:49,791
<i>Stay open, and life will bring you</i>
<i>someone special to mother.</i>

1480
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:54,125
<i>Okay, you know what?</i>
<i>I knew it. This whole thing is a joke.</i>

1481
01:03:54,208 --> 01:03:56,583
<i>Come on. You don't need this.</i>
<i>You don't. Let's go.</i>

1482
01:03:57,416 --> 01:03:58,708
<i>Not so fast, Ketel One.</i>

1483
01:04:11,041 --> 01:04:13,958
<i>Thank you so much for helping out.</i>
<i>You're such a buddy.</i>

1484
01:04:14,041 --> 01:04:16,041
<i>And listen, I'm here if you ever...</i>

1485
01:04:16,125 --> 01:04:18,375
<i>need to talk about your dead wife.</i>

1486
01:04:18,458 --> 01:04:20,500
<i>Wife. Your deceased spouse...</i>

1487
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,916
<i>who has passed away. What do you call her?</i>

1488
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,125
<i>-Rachel.</i>
<i>-Rachel, yeah.</i>

1489
01:04:25,208 --> 01:04:26,750
<i>-Yep, that's her name.</i>
<i>-Makes more sense.</i>

1490
01:04:26,833 --> 01:04:29,875
<i>-I'm so sorry.</i>
<i>-No, you're all good. It's okay.</i>

1491
01:04:30,416 --> 01:04:31,583
<i>That's gotta be tough.</i>

1492
01:04:31,666 --> 01:04:34,625
<i>[chuckles] People like to skate around </i>
<i>the subject, you know?</i>

1493
01:04:34,708 --> 01:04:36,333
<i>But, Rachel, she...</i>

1494
01:04:37,208 --> 01:04:39,333
<i>she would've appreciated your directness.</i>

1495
01:04:39,708 --> 01:04:42,041
<i>-Was she funny?</i>
<i>-Oh, yeah.</i>

1496
01:04:42,500 --> 01:04:44,750
<i>That was our favorite thing to do,</i>
<i>was laugh.</i>

1497
01:04:44,833 --> 01:04:47,500
<i>And honestly, that's one of the things</i>
<i>that I miss most about her,</i>

1498
01:04:47,583 --> 01:04:50,041
<i>is having someone</i>
<i>just give a little nudge</i>

1499
01:04:50,125 --> 01:04:51,875
<i>and say,</i>
<i>"You see what this jackass is doing?"</i>

1500
01:04:51,958 --> 01:04:54,083
<i>Oh, my God, yes. The dinner-party glance.</i>

1501
01:04:54,166 --> 01:04:55,625
<i>-Yes.</i>
<i>-When you both clock</i>

1502
01:04:55,708 --> 01:04:57,125
<i>something insane is happening,</i>

1503
01:04:57,208 --> 01:04:59,333
<i>and you know you get to talk about it</i>
<i>on the drive home.</i>

1504
01:04:59,416 --> 01:05:01,416
<i>-That's my favorite.</i>
<i>-Yeah, me too.</i>

1505
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:02,666
<i>-Right?</i>
<i>-Yeah.</i>

1506
01:05:02,750 --> 01:05:03,833
<i>[chuckles]</i>

1507
01:05:03,916 --> 01:05:04,916
<i>[chuckles]</i>

1508
01:05:06,208 --> 01:05:07,666
<i>Anyway, I-I'm here for you.</i>

1509
01:05:07,750 --> 01:05:11,666
<i>-Thank you, I appreciate that, though.</i>
<i>-Honestly, I'm a guidance counselor.</i>

1510
01:05:12,250 --> 01:05:13,333
<i>No shit!</i>

1511
01:05:13,416 --> 01:05:15,416
<i>I am. Why are you so surprised?</i>

1512
01:05:15,500 --> 01:05:17,083
<i>-People pay you to give advice?</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

1513
01:05:17,166 --> 01:05:18,916
<i>-Wow.</i>
<i>-They will when I get a job.</i>

1514
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:19,958
<i>That's pretty cool.</i>

1515
01:05:23,500 --> 01:05:25,041
<i>Wait, why are the vans splitting up?</i>

1516
01:05:25,125 --> 01:05:26,083
<i>It's decision time, Wes.</i>

1517
01:05:26,166 --> 01:05:28,666
<i>Do we follow Jared,</i>
<i>or do we follow Jared's stuff? </i>

1518
01:05:28,750 --> 01:05:29,958
<i>I say we follow Jared--</i>

1519
01:05:30,041 --> 01:05:32,375
<i>-Sean, his stuff is-- Go!</i>
<i>-Okay!</i>

1520
01:05:32,875 --> 01:05:33,833
<i>Chill.</i>

1521
01:05:37,125 --> 01:05:40,500
<i>I know you're wondering</i>
<i>if this is a good idea, and the answer is:</i>

1522
01:05:40,583 --> 01:05:42,208
<i>-"Please shut up."</i>
<i>-Keep it up.</i>

1523
01:05:42,291 --> 01:05:43,208
<i>[goat bleats]</i>

<i>-You okay?</i>
<i>-I'm good. We're okay.</i>

<i>-Oh!</i>
<i>-Shit. They're getting away. Come on!</i>

1535
01:06:10,791 --> 01:06:11,958
<i>Sean, push the car!</i>

1536
01:06:12,041 --> 01:06:13,791
<i>That's like 2,000 pounds. You crazy?</i>

<i>-[straining grunts]</i>
<i>-[effort grunts]</i>

<i>[sighs] You're doing nothing.</i>

1539

<i>Sean, help me flip the car. Come on!</i>

1540
01:06:20,708 --> 01:06:23,375
<i>-"Flip the car"?</i>
<i>-Yes, people can flip cars</i>

1541
01:06:23,458 --> 01:06:25,541
<i>-in moments of crisis.</i>
<i>-This is a crisis?</i>

1542

<i>-Yes, my love life is a crisis right now!</i>
<i>-Aye-aye...</i>

<i>-Okay.</i>
<i>-One, two, three.</i>

<i>-[effort grunts] Fuck!</i>
<i>-Fuck.</i>

<i>-The goat's a bitch?</i>

<i>We have no idea where we are--</i>
<i>Why are you laughing?</i>

<i>[chuckles]</i>

01:06:50,583 --> 01:06:51,833
<i>Is this for real?</i>

1553
01:06:51,916 --> 01:06:54,791
<i>-And where the hell are we?</i>
<i>-I don't know where we are.</i>

1554
01:06:54,875 --> 01:06:58,250
<i>-We'll figure it out. Hey.</i>
<i>-Oh, my God.</i>

1555

<i>Hey, look at me.</i>

1556

01:07:07,541 --> 01:07:08,833
<i>[sighs] Um...</i>

1559
01:07:09,791 --> 01:07:11,000
<i>[sighs] We walk.</i>

<i>Come on.</i>

01:07:17,583 --> 01:07:18,416
<i>We walk.</i>

<i>[inhales deeply]</i>

1567
01:07:31,333 --> 01:07:34,833
<i>Feel the softness of the air</i>
<i>as it flows through your bodily vessel.</i>

1568
01:07:35,125 --> 01:07:39,375
<i>The air is nurturing your flower,</i>
<i>and it's opening... [breathing heavily]</i>

1569
01:07:39,750 --> 01:07:41,708
<i>Feel the flower open, Brooke.</i>

1570

<i>Feel your roots going deep into the earth,</i>

<i>You can just cut the crap, right now. </i>

<i>Just drop the act</i>
<i>'cause I know you're just a Goop wannabe.</i>

<i>And I also think</i>

<i>to my very sweet,</i>
<i>sensitive friend out there.</i>

1578

<i>Well, I'm honest.</i>
<i>Don't you fancy yourself a truth-teller?</i>

1579
01:08:04,250 --> 01:08:06,458
<i>Yeah, I guess you could say that,</i>

<i>Your heart is sad.</i>

1582
01:08:16,500 --> 01:08:20,291
<i>Unbroken eye contact</i>
<i>is a particular kind of torture.</i>

1583
01:08:22,041 --> 01:08:24,708
<i>But you would put a bunch of fire--</i>
<i>Never mind.</i>

1584
01:08:24,791 --> 01:08:26,625
<i>-For a million dollars, I would.</i>
<i>-One million?</i>

1585
01:08:26,708 --> 01:08:28,000
<i>-Fire ants in my butt?</i>
<i>-What?</i>

1586
01:08:28,083 --> 01:08:30,375
<i>-That's a lot of money. [chuckles]</i>
<i>-Oh, my goodness.</i>

1587
01:08:30,500 --> 01:08:32,375
<i>Okay, this is gonna sound strange,</i>

1588
01:08:32,791 --> 01:08:34,583
<i>-very strange, but...</i>
<i>-Okay.</i>

1589
01:08:34,666 --> 01:08:38,166
<i>...kicking it with you</i>
<i>has kind of been the best part of my trip.</i>

1590
01:08:38,250 --> 01:08:39,625
<i>-What?</i>
<i>-Yeah.</i>

1591
01:08:39,750 --> 01:08:42,458
<i>-We were just in a car accident. </i>
<i>-I get it.</i>

1592
01:08:43,083 --> 01:08:45,541
<i>I get it.</i>
<i>You definitely come with some nonsense.</i>

1593
01:08:45,625 --> 01:08:47,583
<i>Look, meaning, you got some layers.</i>

1594
01:08:47,708 --> 01:08:49,375
<i>-Oh no, that's fair. Yeah.</i>
<i>-Right.</i>

1595
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:52,208
<i>You see, that's why I think you'd make</i>
<i>a great guidance counselor.</i>

1596
01:08:52,291 --> 01:08:54,916
<i>You're like a kid, kind of.</i>
<i>Not in a bad way.</i>

1597
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:59,083
<i>What I'm saying is,</i>
<i>you have a very youthful soul, you know?</i>

1598
01:08:59,791 --> 01:09:02,916
<i>Wanna hear something crazy?</i>
<i>I used to be in corporate finance.</i>

1599
01:09:03,916 --> 01:09:05,166
<i>-That's very weird.</i>
<i>-Yeah.</i>

1600
01:09:05,250 --> 01:09:06,416
<i>[chuckles] Very weird fit.</i>

1601
01:09:06,500 --> 01:09:10,416
<i>Not for me. But eventually,</i>
<i>I followed my passion, and...</i>

1602
01:09:11,416 --> 01:09:13,333
<i>that's not really working out either.</i>

1603
01:09:14,291 --> 01:09:15,541
<i>I don't know what to do.</i>

1604
01:09:15,625 --> 01:09:16,541
<i>Come on, now, Wes,</i>

1605
01:09:16,625 --> 01:09:19,958
<i>eventually you'll find that one place</i>
<i>that appreciates you for you.</i>

1606
01:09:20,458 --> 01:09:22,083
<i>Yeah, if that place even exists.</i>

1607
01:09:22,250 --> 01:09:24,708
<i>[sighs] Don't worry so much, Wes.</i>

1608
01:09:25,416 --> 01:09:27,000
<i>The world will catch up to you.</i>

1609
01:09:29,291 --> 01:09:30,208
<i>Wait, wait, wait.</i>

1610
01:09:30,291 --> 01:09:31,958
<i>[indistinct Spanish chatter]</i>

1611
01:09:32,041 --> 01:09:33,458
<i>Oh, my God. Is that the van?</i>

1612
01:09:34,833 --> 01:09:36,541
<i>That van has Jared's bag in it.</i>

1613
01:09:36,625 --> 01:09:39,166
<i>[Mariachi music playing]</i>

1614
01:09:39,875 --> 01:09:41,041
<i>He's playing in a band?</i>

1615
01:09:42,041 --> 01:09:43,875
<i>What is happening?</i>

1616
01:09:44,416 --> 01:09:46,125
<i>Ah, it's a quinceañera.</i>

1617
01:09:46,208 --> 01:09:48,083
<i>It's like a Mexican sweet 16,</i>
<i>only she's 15.</i>

1618
01:09:48,166 --> 01:09:50,791
<i>It's a combination of the words,</i>
"quince,"<i> meaning "15,"</i>

1619
01:09:50,875 --> 01:09:53,291
<i>you understand?</i>
<i>And </i>"años,"<i> meaning "years."</i>

1620
01:09:53,375 --> 01:09:55,041
<i>I know what a quinceañera is, Sean.</i>

1621
01:09:55,125 --> 01:09:57,541
<i>-You know what that is?</i>
<i>-Why's he at the quinceañera?</i>

1622
01:09:57,625 --> 01:10:00,708
<i>-He's supposed to be at the airport.</i>
<i>-I don't know, he's hopping out of a cake.</i>

1623
01:10:00,791 --> 01:10:01,958
<i>I do not know this man.</i>

1624
01:10:02,041 --> 01:10:05,041
<i>Dude, come on. We gotta find out</i>
<i>what the driver's doing here.</i>

1625
01:10:05,125 --> 01:10:07,250
<i>I wonder if they got tacos in there.</i>

1626
01:10:07,708 --> 01:10:09,625
<i>That's really not important right now.</i>

1627
01:10:09,708 --> 01:10:11,750
<i>It's the most important thing</i>
<i>I can think of.</i>

1628
01:10:13,375 --> 01:10:14,875
<i>Another hot pile of horseshit.</i>

1629

<i>[pounding]</i>

<i>so I'm feeling a little tender.</i>

1633
01:10:28,250 --> 01:10:32,500
<i>I'm gonna be hosting a class</i>
<i>by the aqueduct tomorrow morning called:</i>

<i>"Losers never win,</i>
<i>you can eat shit all day,</i>

1635

<i>You have a beautiful soul. Let it out.</i>

01:11:01,541 --> 01:11:02,416
<i>[sighs]</i>

1643
01:11:02,500 --> 01:11:05,833
<i>-I don't know what's happening.</i>
<i>-You're feeling your feelings, Brooke.</i>

1644
01:11:05,916 --> 01:11:07,875
<i>Our hearts are talking through my hand.</i>

1645

01:11:20,166 --> 01:11:23,750
<i>No, you just saw the indentation</i>
<i>where my wedding ring used to be.</i>

1653
01:11:23,833 --> 01:11:25,541
<i>That doesn't mean</i>
<i>that my marriage is over.</i>

1654
01:11:25,916 --> 01:11:26,875
<i>It is.</i>

1655
01:11:27,333 --> 01:11:30,458
<i>You know it already,</i>
<i>but you haven't let yourself feel it.</i>

1656

<i>[breathes heavily]</i>

1657
01:11:31,916 --> 01:11:34,208
<i>Pain and sadness,</i>
<i>it's uncomfortable for you.</i>

1658
01:11:34,291 --> 01:11:35,541
<i>-Yeah.</i>
<i>-Anger feels safer.</i>

1659
01:11:35,625 --> 01:11:37,791
<i>-It does.</i>
<i>-Beware, beautiful Brooke,</i>

1660
01:11:37,875 --> 01:11:40,541
<i>that rage fuels you now,</i>
<i>but it will destroy you,</i>

1661
01:11:40,625 --> 01:11:42,833
<i>and it would destroy the life</i>
<i>of your child.</i>

1662

<i>-You love him so much, it's so--</i>
<i>-I love my son.</i>

1663

<i>But you have to love yourself first.</i>

1664

<i>-You have to love your inner child.</i>
<i>-I have to love myself.</i>

1665

<i>Love baby Brooke.</i>
<i>Do you know where she is right now?</i>

1666
01:11:52,833 --> 01:11:54,791
<i>God, baby Brooke.</i>
<i>I have to love her. Where is she?</i>

<i>[breathes heavily]</i>

1672
01:12:04,250 --> 01:12:07,708

<i>-It's all taken care of.</i>
<i>-It is?</i>

1688
01:12:41,250 --> 01:12:43,166

<i>So, her brother, the driver,</i>

<i>-Oh, speak for yourself. [chomps]</i>

1697
01:13:02,125 --> 01:13:05,833

<i>Mm..</i>

<i>What if we gave it a shot?</i>

2216
01:38:21,375 --> 01:38:22,708
<i>I like you too. I...</i>

2217
01:38:23,916 --> 01:38:24,750
<i>[sighs]</i>

2218
01:38:25,916 --> 01:38:26,875
<i>But?</i>

2219
01:38:26,958 --> 01:38:30,625
<i>Wes, I don't think I'm--</i>
<i>I don't think I'm there.</i>

2220
01:38:31,083 --> 01:38:33,333
<i>You're literally on a date right now.</i>

2221
01:38:34,625 --> 01:38:35,666
<i>This is casual.</i>

2222
01:38:37,416 --> 01:38:39,875
<i>What we had in Mexico was real.</i>

2223
01:38:40,375 --> 01:38:43,416
<i>You would be more than just a date.</i>

2224
01:38:43,500 --> 01:38:46,208
<i>You see, you deserve somebody</i>
<i>that's gonna sweep you off your feet.</i>

2225
01:38:47,791 --> 01:38:49,833
<i>Am I able to be that person again?</i>

2226
01:38:49,916 --> 01:38:51,916
<i>I wanna say that I am, but honestly...</i>

2227
01:38:53,583 --> 01:38:56,791
<i>[smack lips] I just, I just don't know.</i>

2228
01:38:59,875 --> 01:39:01,708
<i>Okay, I'm sorry I interrupted.</i>

2229
01:39:02,083 --> 01:39:04,500
<i>-Thanks, Sean.</i>
<i>-Wes.</i>

2230
01:39:11,083 --> 01:39:12,041

<i>basement's okay,</i>

2233
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:20,250

2234
01:39:21,875 --> 01:39:23,250
<i>I'm sorry. What? [chuckles]</i>

2235
01:39:23,916 --> 01:39:25,375
<i>Like, on a date.</i>

2236
01:39:27,083 --> 01:39:28,750
<i>[sighs]</i>

2237
01:39:30,708 --> 01:39:32,250
<i>-[sighs]</i>
<i>-Wes.</i>

2238
01:39:36,125 --> 01:39:36,958
<i>Look...</i>

2239
01:39:37,875 --> 01:39:40,041
<i>I wasn't supposed to meet somebody</i>
<i>so fast.</i>

2240
01:39:40,125 --> 01:39:43,208
<i>You know?</i>
<i>I was... just getting my feet wet.</i>

2241
01:39:44,583 --> 01:39:46,833
<i>Oh, my God. You don't need to say that.</i>
<i>[chuckles]</i>

2242
01:39:46,916 --> 01:39:49,666
<i>I-- honestly, it's fine. I'm fine.</i>

2243
01:39:49,750 --> 01:39:53,583
<i>That's the thing, Wes.</i>
<i>I'm not okay with just being fine.</i>

2244
01:39:54,875 --> 01:39:57,333
<i>I want more than that. I wanna be...</i>

2245
01:39:57,875 --> 01:39:59,791

2246
01:40:00,291 --> 01:40:01,791

2247
01:40:02,750 --> 01:40:03,583

2248
01:40:03,833 --> 01:40:06,291
<i>I wanna watch you dancing, you know?</i>

2249
01:40:06,375 --> 01:40:07,750
<i>Like you have nerve damage.</i>

2250
01:40:09,125 --> 01:40:11,250
<i>Wes, you are messy...</i>

2251
01:40:12,250 --> 01:40:13,583
<i>and complicated...</i>

2252
01:40:14,333 --> 01:40:15,708
<i>and so perfectly you.</i>

2253
01:40:16,375 --> 01:40:18,416
<i>And I haven't felt like this</i>
<i>in a long time,</i>

2254
01:40:19,583 --> 01:40:21,041
<i>and I don't want it to end.</i>

2255
01:40:21,125 --> 01:40:22,666
<i>Me neither, Sean.</i>

2256
01:40:23,875 --> 01:40:24,875
